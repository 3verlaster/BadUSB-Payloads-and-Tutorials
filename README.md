## Briefly about the repository, and what we will do
Here I will tell you how to turn your smartphone into a tool that can carry out HID Attacks. Simply put - BadUSB from your phone

## How it works ❓
In our case, we will use the program "USB Gadget Tool". It simulates HID (Human Interface Devices) from your smartphone.
When you connect your smartphone to your computer, it looks at what kind of device it is. Since we are imitating HID, the computer will consider our phone as a keyboard. It's funny, isn't it?
